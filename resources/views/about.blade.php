            <p class="usualParagraph">Tracking scholarly performance is challenging, especially given the continuous stream of new publications and resulting citation activity.  Over the past three years, I have been collecting data about urban planning scholarship, most recently posting rankings of ACSP member schools on my blog at&nbsp;<a href="http://tomwsanchez.com/" target="_blank">tomwsanchez.com<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, which includes faculty rankings for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://tomwsanchez.com/faculty-scholarly-productivity-and-reputation-in-planning-a-preliminary-citation-analysis/">2013<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://tomwsanchez.com/2014-urban-planning-citation-analysis/">2014<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://tomwsanchez.com/2015-urban-planning-citation-analysis/">2015<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. During this time, I have also been working on a tool to make these data accessible to faculty and their departments. Although the website is in its early stages, I am looking to get feedback on data accuracy (e.g., faculty rosters) and ideas for additional analyses/metrics.  In the works are more complete profile information for individual faculty and departments, peer comparisons based on research areas and faculty rank, and network analyses of co-authorship.</p>
